# Hangman
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 

Currently the "milestone_2.py" file contains a list of 5 strings representing fruits. It then picks one at random using the random module. Then it asks the user for some input, and finally checks if the input is a string containing one character and is contained in the alphabet. I don't know what the rest of the files are supposed to do, but whatever.
